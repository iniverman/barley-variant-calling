# barley-variant-calling-using-freebayes
In this repository we perform a variant calling study using two reads of a barley sample. For that we used freebayes to perform the variant study.

Variant calling allow us to detect and study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels) ,among other, from a sequence previously get from next generation sequencing (NGS). To do this we will use freebayes, a bayesian genetic variant detector that is haplotype based, that means that it calls variant based on the literal sequenced reads aligned to a particular target, not their precise alignment.
